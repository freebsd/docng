== Go fix/close a PR!

It's easy, all you have to do is to follow https://bugs.FreeBSD.org/search/[this link to the Bugzilla database], find a PR, figure out what needs done and do it.

If you are a committer, you can use the web interface to close PRs.

If you are not a committer, you should submit a followup containing the text :

[.text-center]
....
This PR can be closed
....

on a line of its own, that will make it easier for a committer to deal with it later.

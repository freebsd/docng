= Installing the FreeBSD Ports Collection

{{< form-ports >}}

'''''

The FreeBSD installer programs allow the Ports Collection to be installed at the same time as the operating system. See link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bsdinstall[`bsdinstall`] for FreeBSD 9.X and later versions, or link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysinstall[`sysinstall`] for FreeBSD 8.X and earlier versions.

If the Ports Collection is not initially installed, it can be added with {{< books "handbook" "portsnap" "ports-using.html" >}} or {{< books "handbook" "Subversion" "svn.html" >}}.

To start learning more about ports and packages, see {{< books "handbook" "Installing Applications: Packages and Ports" "ports.html" >}}, a section of the {{< books "handbook" "FreeBSD Handbook" >}}.

The {{< books "porters-handbook" "Porter's Handbook" >}} is the master reference for both creating new ports and maintaining existing ports, including a section on {{< books "porters-handbook" "Keeping Up" "keeping-up.html" >}}. It also contains more detail about the topics below, as well as more references for further study.

You may also find the following to be useful:

* The archives of the https://docs.FreeBSD.org/mail/current/freebsd-ports.html[FreeBSD ports mailing list].
* The article {{< articles "contributing" "Contributing to the FreeBSD Ports Collection" "ports-contributing.html" >}}.
* https://www.FreshPorts.org[FreshPorts.org] is a valuable tool for further information about individual ports, such as current version, last checkin, and many other useful statistics. You may subscribe to a mailing list to get the latest information about your favorite ports.
* The manual pages for link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ftp[`ftp`], link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg&sektion=8[`pkg`], and link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ports[`ports`].
* The link:../../portmgr/[Ports Management Team] (portmgr) pages.
* The https://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/ports[Web Interface to the Source Repository] allows you to browse the files in the source repository. Changes that affect the entire port system are now documented in the https://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/ports/head/CHANGES?view=markup[CHANGES] file. Changes that affect individual ports are now documented in the https://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/ports/head/UPDATING?view=markup[UPDATING] file. However, the definitive answer to any question is undoubtedly to read the source code of https://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/ports/head/Mk/bsd.port.mk?view=markup[bsd.port.mk], and associated files.

= Searching FreeBSD Ports

{{< form-ports >}}

'''''

The form above will allow you to search for ports on this site. A completed search will take you to a link:https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/ports.cgi[more complete search page].

However, if you already have the Ports Collection installed on your machine, you may also search by changing to the `/usr/ports` directory and performing `make search name=`__string__. See http://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/ports/head/Mk/bsd.port.subdir.mk?view=log[bsd.port.subdir.mk] for all the options.

Another option is to visit https://www.FreshPorts.org[FreshPorts.org] and either browse the site or subscribe to the lists hosted there.

= User Groups

FreeBSD's widespread popularity has spawned a number of user groups around the world.

If you know of a FreeBSD user group not listed here, please fill out a link:../support/bugreports[problem report] in category Documentation->Website with the following information:

. A URL for the user group's website.
. An email contact address of a human in charge, for use by our visitors and website administrators.
. A short (one paragraph) description of the user group.

Submissions should be in HTML. In keeping with the spirit of FreeBSD, we prefer user groups that are active and which conduct their business in public. If there is no local group, http://bsd.meetup.com/ can be used to locate interested individuals near by. Consider forming your own user group!

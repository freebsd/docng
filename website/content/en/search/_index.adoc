== Mailing list archives

The https://www.FreeBSD.org/mail/[mailing list archive] indexes are now updated weekly!

An alternative way to read the mailing lists archives is to use the http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo[Mailman/Pipermail list archive] (note that this archive only carries messages from March 2003 onward).

The mailing lists (as well as many others) have also been archived by http://markmail.org/browse/?q=list:org.freebsd[MarkMail].

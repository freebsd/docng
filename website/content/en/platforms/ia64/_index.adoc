[[intro]]
== Introduction

The FreeBSD/ia64 project pages contain information about the FreeBSD port to Intel's IA-64 architecture; officially known as the Intel Itanium(R) Processor Family (IPF). As with the port itself, these pages are still mostly a work in progress.

[[status]]
== Current status

The ia64 port is considered a tier 2 platform through FreeBSD 10. After this it will no longer be supported.

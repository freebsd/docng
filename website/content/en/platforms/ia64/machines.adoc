= FreeBSD/ia64 Project -- machines

== Machines on the market

On this page we try to collect the different machines one can buy now or could buy in the recent past. Presence here does not mean that FreeBSD has been validated to run on it. We get to that eventually. If a particular machine is not listed here, chances are we do not know about it. Note that the Merced based machines are not listed here, even though they are supported. The reason for this is simply that they are not interesting anymore.

= FreeBSD/ppc Project

== Introduction

The FreeBSD/ppc project pages contain information about the FreeBSD port to the PowerPC(R) architecture. As with the port itself, these pages are still a work in progress.

[[status]]
== Status

The FreeBSD/ppc port is still a link:{committers-guide}#archs[Tier 2] platform. That means it is not being fully supported by our security officer, release engineers and toolchain maintainers. However, it is supported by portmgr (package building).

The most up-to-date information about supported hardware is currently being maintained https://wiki.freebsd.org/powerpc[on the wiki].

[[install]]
=== How can I install FreeBSD/ppc?

ISO images of FreeBSD {rel120-current} are available for download, for details on how to obtain these see the link:../../releases/{rel120-current}r/announce/[release announcement.]

[[ports]]
=== How to use ports on FreeBSD/ppc?

The easiest way to use ports on FreeBSD is to use portsnap. (if running FreeBSD {rel114-current} or {rel121-current}) or Subversion (if running FreeBSD-CURRENT). Refer to the Handbook if you need assistance to link:{handbook}#ports-using[use the Ports Collection].

[[ppcppc64]]
=== Should I install powerpc or powerpc64?

The powerpc64 port provides a 64-bit kernel and userland, and is supported on all 64-bit CPUs. Users of 32-bit CPUs (Apple G3/G4) must use the 32-bit powerpc platform, users of 64-bit CPUs that support 32-bit operating systems (Apple G5) have a choice, and users of 64-bit CPUs that do not must use powerpc64. For those users with a choice, powerpc64 provides some additional features (the ability to use more than 2 GB of RAM and ZFS support). Like other 64-bit platforms, FreeBSD/powerpc64 supports running 32-bit binaries as well as 64-bit ones.

[[hardware]]
== Supported Hardware

The most up-to-date information about supported hardware is currently being maintained https://wiki.freebsd.org/powerpc[on the wiki].

The FreeBSD/ppc port should run on any New-World Apple machine (any Apple machine with a built-in USB port), as well as the Sony Playstation 3.

People have previously reported that FreeBSD runs on the following machines:

[[issues]]
== Known Issues

* On New-World Apples, there is a known bug in the boot-loader, that prevents you from loading an alternate kernel, so testing your kernel is a bit risky. When booting the loader from the Open Firmware prompt, give it a partition which is either non-existent, doesn't have a kernel to load, or isn't a UFS partition:
+
....
0 > boot hd:loader hd:0
....
+
At this point, you can set currdev and manually load a kernel:
+
....
OK set currdev="hd":14
OK load /boot/kernel/kernel.save
....

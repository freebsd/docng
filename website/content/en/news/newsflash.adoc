= FreeBSD News Flash

FreeBSD is a rapidly developing operating system. Keeping up on the latest developments can be a chore! To keep on top of things, check this page periodically. News is also announced on the https://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-announce[freebsd-announce mailing] list and the RSS feed.

The following projects have their own news pages, which should be checked for project specific updates.

* http://freebsd.kde.org/[KDE on FreeBSD]
* GNOME on FreeBSD

For a detailed description of past, present, and future releases, see the Release Information page.

FreeBSD security information and a list of available Security Advisories are available on the Security Information page.

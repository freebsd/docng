FreeBSD releases are classified into _Production Releases_ and _Legacy Releases_. Production releases are best suited to users looking for the latest new features. Legacy releases are for users wishing to stay with a more conservative upgrade strategy.

Documentation files for each release are available for viewing in HTML format on the link:../relnotes/[Release Documentation] page.
